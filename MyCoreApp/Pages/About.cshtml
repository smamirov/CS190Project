<h3>About the APOD API according to NASA description:</h3>
<p>
    "One of the most popular websites at NASA is the Astronomy Picture of the Day.
     In fact, this website is one of the most popular websites across all federal agencies.
     It has the popular appeal of a Justin Bieber video. This endpoint structures
     the APOD imagery and associated metadata so that it can be repurposed for other
     applications. In addition, if the concept_tags parameter is set to True, then
     keywords derived from the image explanation are returned. These keywords could be
     used as auto-generated hashtags for twitter or instagram feeds; but generally help
     with discoverability of relevant imagery."
